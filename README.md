# Sneakahs
# 🛒 Sneakahs Ecommerce Backend

This is a fully functional ecommerce backend API built with **C# and ASP.NET Core**, following **Clean Architecture** principles. It supports user authentication, product browsing, cart management, Stripe checkout integration, and order tracking — all backed by a PostgreSQL database and JWT-based authentication.

> ⚠️ This is a **backend-only** project. No frontend is included, but the API is fully ready to integrate with any frontend or mobile application.
